What it does?
It's a .dll library that patches some assembler functions to make the game easier.

How to use:
Inject Release\BindingOfIsaacAfterbirth+.dll to the game process with any dll injector and follow hotkey instructions.

Warning! 
This project is no longer mantained and at the moment can be not working because after every new version release of the game you need to update the injection points.
